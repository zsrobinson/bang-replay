# Bang Replay üí• üîÅ

**View this project:** https://bang.zsrobinson.com

This is a simple redirection engine <em>(not a search engine!)</em> that
keeps track of your searches locally. Inspired by
<a href="https://unduck.link/">Und\*ck</a> by Theo Browne and extended by
IndexedDB to save previous queries. This was mostly a learning exercise
and proof of concept for using IndexedDB in a larger project, and only
uses vanilla JavaScript APIs without any libraries or build steps. If I‚Äôm
going to recommend someone learn vanilla HTML/CSS/JS before using
something like React, then I figured I should know what the regular
IndexedDB API looks like before using a wrapper for it (and hey, I might
as well use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS too while I‚Äôm at it). The page resources
are cached on the client so that every search doesn't require a roundtrip
to fetch the mostly static files this site uses. While only a limited
number of hardcoded bangs are supported here, it would be pretty trivial
to instead perform a lookup on all of the ones that DuckDuckGo uses
themselves.

Changing the default search engine on firefox is weird, had to follow [this thread on Stack Exchange](https://superuser.com/a/1756774).
