      <summary><b>About this project</b></summary>

      This is a simple redirection engine <em>(not a search engine!)</em> that
      keeps track of your searches locally. Inspired by
      <a href="https://unduck.link/">Und*ck</a> by Theo Browne and extended by
      IndexedDB to save previous queries. This was mostly a learning exercise
      and proof of concept for using IndexedDB in a larger project, and only
      uses vanilla JavaScript APIs without any libraries or build steps. If I‚Äôm
      going to recommend someone learn vanilla HTML/CSS/JS before using
      something like React, then I figured I should know what the regular
      IndexedDB API looks like before using a wrapper for it (and hey, I might
      as well use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS too while I‚Äôm at it). The page resources
      are cached on the client so that every search doesn't require a roundtrip
      to fetch the mostly static files this site uses. While only a limited
      number of hardcoded bangs are supported here, it would be pretty trivial
      to instead perform a lookup on all of the ones that DuckDuckGo uses
      themselves.

      To search, use the box below or configure your browser to use
      <code>https://bang.zsrobinson.com?q=%s</code> as it‚Äôs custom search
      engine. Since everything is kept local, your searches are not sent to any
      servers besides those of the search engine you‚Äôre forwarded to.
